## Introduction

It has been a long time since I started thinking about why software engineers change their technology stacks, and sometimes I think to change too. I have worked with the .NET stack using C# language for 8 years, I like this stack so much that sometimes I think "Why do I need to change the technology stack or language?". Maybe I want to feel comfortable, and let's face it, it's hard and it takes time to change the technology stack, or sometimes I want to be a specialist with a stack.


By the end of this article, I will have stated my opinion on whether to change or not, but in the meantime let's analyze the bubble, and see the outside. Over the years, I have seen many software engineers switch from one programming language or technology stack to another. It happens in almost every corner of the software development industry. But why do software engineers make these changes? What motivates them to learn new programming languages or tools? Let's see!

Software engineers change stacks or languages for a variety of reasons, including personal interest, career advancement, changes in industry trends or needs, and a desire to learn something new. Here are some more detailed explanations:

- **Personal Interest**: Software engineers are often passionate about programming and may want to explore different stacks or languages to satisfy their curiosity or to challenge themselves. They may find that they are drawn to a particular stack or language because of its unique features, syntax, or development philosophy;

- **Career Advancement**: Another reason is career advancement, switching to a new programming stack or language can be a way for software engineers to advance their career prospects. Some employers may require experience with specific stacks or languages, and gaining expertise in those areas can make a software engineer a more desirable job candidate. Or they might find new challenges with projects and need to understand better the specific language required for the project. Additionally, software engineers may find that learning a new stack or language can broaden their skill set and make them more valuable to potential employers;

- **Changes in industry trends or needs**: As new technologies emerge and industry needs change, software engineers may need to learn new programming stacks or languages to stay relevant;

- **The desire for new challenges or to learn something new**: Some software engineers want to learn something new and challenge themselves, programming with other stacks or languages can be a way to expand their knowledge and gain experience with different development tools and workflows.

I created a Google form survey to understand which developers change stacks (programming languages or frameworks) and their reasons. Of the 31 respondents, 74.2% have already thought about changing their development stack and the reasons are the same: salaries, job market, and challenges. But remember that only 31 people answered the survey.

### Conclusion

We do not necessarily need to change all the time, I guess everybody has their priorities. Some people don't care about working for years on the same project or the same framework or languages, and there are people who don't like staying in their comfort zone, and that is okay. 

But I can see some points on how to understand your priorities. For example, what do you want for yourself in three or four years? What are your goals? Do you want to be a generalist or a specialist? Do you like challenges? One thing is certain: programming languages are just tools that will help solve your problems, nothing more.
