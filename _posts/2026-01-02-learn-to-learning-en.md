## Introduction

Organization is essential for anyone who wants to maintain a study routine. It is quite important to know the best way to study and retain knowledge.

Before showing the strategies to organize your studies, it is vital to understand the impacts of disorganization. Disorganization can lead to significant information loss, making it difficult to retain information effectively, resulting in inefficient cycle frustrations.

I have read some books and done some courses about techniques to optimize knowledge absorption, and I could understand how our brain works when we are learning something.

### Get organized

I have read a book called “I have already understood” in Portuguese — Eu já Entendi, by Gladys Mariotto. The book talks about how we can organize our studies and teaches some techniques for our brain to retain information, and it describes the three processes that occur during the learning phase, which are:

- **Read**: Reading provides the initial contact with the content, in any area and in any format;

- **Organize**: Organizing the content is essential for defining better ways to structure your readings. You can use colorful summaries, index cards, or a combination of these and other methods;

- **Assimilate**: Assimilating the content is the moment when our memory works to keep all the knowledge. The prior knowledge helps us when we need to retain information because it gives context and meaning to new ideas. When we connect new content with something we already know, it is easier for the brain to organize and store the information.
